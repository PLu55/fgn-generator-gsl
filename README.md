# Fractional Gaussian noise generator
The code in this repository is an implementation of the approximate circulant algorithm used to generate fractional Gaussian noise. This algorithm was proposed in a paper by [Dieker and Mendes (2003)](https://doi.org/10.1017/S0269964803173081).

The code is modified to speed up the generation, especially consectutive calls. It's using [FFTW3](http://www.fftw.org/) insted of the much slower GSL implementation of the FFT. A function and a data structure to handle one time initialization is implemented. It still depends on the GSL for random number generation. File are renamed and a new function that returns Fractiona Brownian Motion (FBm) is added.

This implementation is a fork of Aleksejus Kononovicius implemenation which heavily reuses code made available by Ton Dieker at [http://www.columbia.edu/~ad3217/fbm.html](http://www.columbia.edu/~ad3217/fbm.html). The main difference from the previous implementation is that this implementation relies on [GNU Scientific Library](https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/) instead of [Ranlib and Meschach](http://www.netlib.org/). The possibility to generate fractional Brownian motion was also removed as it is redundant. Namely this functionality can be implemented outside this generation algorithm.
